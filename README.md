# sign-up-form
This is a sign up form i created for Odin Project. I learned form components, how to visualize and little stuff and put it into a test in this project. 

Note: "*Passwords do not match." is just there and does nothing. It should come alive with constraint api but, scope of the project doesn't include that.
